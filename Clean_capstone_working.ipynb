If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work--usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dog-breeds/characteristics/low-intelligence\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See Dogs Who Have Lower Intelligence</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Potential For Mouthiness</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-2\">2</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><p>Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in Retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats.</p></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Prey Drive</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-2\">2</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><div class=\"mceTemp\"><p><img alt=\"dog running in field\" class=\"wp-image-55015 size-full\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-829378994-e1586370543146.jpg\" width=\"680\"/></p><ul class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_55015\" style=\"width: 680px;\">(Picture Credit: Haydn West - PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images)</ul></div><p>Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase--and sometimes kill--other animals. Anything whizzing by, such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars, can trigger that instinct. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dog-breeds/characteristics/low-prey-drive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See Dogs Who Have Low Prey Drive</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Tendency To Bark Or Howl</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-3\">3</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><p>Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes with barks or howls. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dog-breeds/characteristics/mostly-quiet\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See Dogs Who Are Mostly Quiet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Wanderlust Potential</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-3\">3</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><p>Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses--or that bunny that just ran across the path--even if it means leaving you behind.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dog-breeds/characteristics/less-prone-to-wander\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See Dogs Less Prone To Wander</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"breed-characteristics-ratings-wrapper paws\"><div class=\"characteristic-stars parent-characteristic\"><h3 class=\"characteristic-title\"> Physical Needs</h3><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-5\"></div></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Energy Level</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-5\">5</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><p>High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells.</p><p>Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying.</p><p>Your dog's energy level can also be affected by health issues.

These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail.

Others need daily, vigorous exercise, especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, like herding or hunting.</p><p>Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility.</p><p>Even older dogs need exercise, and it can help fight symptoms of arthritis and other age-related conditions. <a href=\"https://go.parnell.com/en-us/dogtime-glyde-offer?utm_campaign=US%20Pet%20Parent%20Awareness&amp;utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fdogtime.com%2F&amp;utm_medium=Dogtime&amp;utm_term=PPC&amp;utm_content=arthritis%20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to your dog's routine</strong></a> can give your dog the joint supplements they need to stay active well into old age.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dog-breeds/characteristics/dont-need-tons-of-exercise\">See Dogs Who Don't Need Tons of Exercise</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"js-list-item child-characteristic\"><a class=\"js-list-item-trigger characteristic-stars\"><div class=\"characteristic-title\"><div class=\"more-info-tag\"></div>Potential For Playfulness</div><div class=\"characteristic-star-block\"><div class=\"star star-5\">5</div></div></a><div class=\"js-list-expandable characteristic-description hidden\"><p>Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate.

Loyal, energetic, and affectionate, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.Afadors are also sometimes known as the Afghan Lab. You can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add an Afador to your home!Afadors make excellent family pets, although they do better with older children and seasoned dog owners who can give the breed the training and attention they require. Afadors also make for good guard dogs, and they’re alert to strangers. The mixed breed is very energetic and athletic, so access to a safe outdoor space is preferred.See below for all mixed dog breed traits and facts about Afadors!Afador Mixed Dog Breed Picture (Picture Credit: posted with permission from LA Animal Rescue & Jason Nastaszewski of JNC Media)Breed Characteristics: AdaptabilityAdapts Well To Apartment Living1Contrary to popular belief, small size doesn't necessarily an apartment dog make. Plenty of small dogs are too high-energy and yappy for life in a high-rise. Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents are all good qualities in an apartment dog. And you can find an awesome crate for your dog here to give them a little more personal space in your apartment.See Dogs Not Well Suited to Apartment LivingClick here for more information on this characteristicGood For Novice Owners1Some dogs are simply easier than others; they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies.Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time dog parent to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch.If you're new to dog parenting, take a look at 101 Dog Tricks and read up on how to train your dog!You may also want to consider adopting a senior dog, as they tend to be less demanding of your time and energy. You can keep your senior dog active well into old age by providing them with joint supplements to fight the symptoms of arthritis. Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to their routine can help their joints stay healthy.See Dogs Who Are Good For Experienced OwnersSensitivity Level3Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog.See Dogs Who Have Low Sensitivity LevelsTolerates Being Alone3Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive--barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work.See Dogs Poorly Suited To Be AloneTolerates Cold Weather4Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks. You can find a great jacket for your dog here!Click here to see Dogs Poorly Suited For Cold WeatherDogTime participates in the Chewy affiliate program to earn fees for linking to products on Chewy.com.Click here for more information on this characteristicTolerates Hot Weather2Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, your dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat.See Dogs Poorly Suited For Hot Weather All Around FriendlinessAffectionate With Family4Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.Treats can help the bonding process go more smoothly. Try giving your dog Glyde Mobility Chews to help them see you as a provider and to keep their joints healthy!See Dogs Less Affectionate with FamilyKid-Friendly2Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blasé attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (which are considered Pit Bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't always so family-friendly.See Dogs Who Are Not Kid Friendly**All dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they're not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences, training on how to get along with kids, and personality. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws, sharp pointy teeth, and may bite in stressful circumstances. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone together, period.Click here for more information on this characteristicDog Friendly3Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs, even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run. Breed isn't the only factor. Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age and who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood, are more likely to have good canine social skills.See Dogs Who Are Not So Dog FriendlyClick here for more information on this characteristicFriendly Toward Strangers1Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even aggressive. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash like this one in public!See Dogs Who Are Less Friendly To StrangersDogTime participates in the Chewy affiliate program to earn fees for linking to products on Chewy.com. Health And Grooming NeedsAmount Of Shedding4If you're going to share your home with a dog, you'll need to deal with some level of dog hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds. Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally, some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik, you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed or relax your standards. To help keep your home a little cleaner, you can find a great de-shedding tool here!Click Here To See Dogs Who Shed Very LittleDogTime participates in the Chewy affiliate program to earn fees for linking to products on Chewy.com.Drooling Potential3Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.See Dogs Who Are Not Big DroolersEasy To Groom2Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it.See Dogs Who Require More GroomingGeneral Health3Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk.If you're adopting a puppy, it's a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you're interested in. You may also want to ask if your shelter or rescue has information about the physical health of your potential pup's parents and other relatives.Many health problems are related to digestion and issues in the gut. Adding Bernie's Perfect Poop digestion support treats to your dog's routine can help your pet feel better and improve their overall health!See Dogs More Prone To Health ProblemsPotential For Weight Gain4Some breeds have hearty appetites and tend to put on weight easily. As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs. If you pick a breed that's prone to packing on pounds, you'll need to limit treats, make sure they get enough exercise, and measure out their daily food servings into regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time.Ask your vet about your dog's diet and what they recommend for feeding your pooch to keep them at a healthy weight. If your dog has tummy troubles, adding Bernie's Perfect Poop digestion support treats to their diet can help your dog feel better and improve their overall health!Size4Dogs come in all sizes, from the world's smallest pooch, the Chihuahua, to the towering Great Dane, how much space a dog takes up is a key factor in deciding if they're compatible with you and your living space. Large dog breeds might seem overpowering and intimidating, but some of them are incredibly sweet! Take a look and find the right sized dog for you!Many larger dogs are prone to joint issues. Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to their routine can help their joints stay healthy.See Medium DogsSee Small Dogs TrainabilityEasy To Train1Easy-to-train dogs are more adept at forming an association between a prompt (such as the word \"sit\"), an action (sitting), and a consequence (getting a treat) very quickly. Other dogs need more time, patience, and repetition during training.Many breeds are intelligent but approach training with a \"What's in it for me?\" attitude, in which case you'll need to use rewards and games to teach them to want to comply with your requests. Here are some great treats that can actually improve your dog's digestion to get you started!See Dogs Who Are Challenging To TrainIntelligence5Dogs who were bred for jobs that require decision making, intelligence, and concentration, such as herding livestock, need to exercise their brains, just as dogs who were bred to run all day need to exercise their bodies. If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work--usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue.See Dogs Who Have Lower IntelligencePotential For Mouthiness4Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in Retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats.Prey Drive4(Picture Credit: Haydn West - PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images)Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase--and sometimes kill--other animals. Anything whizzing by, such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars, can trigger that instinct. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.See Dogs Who Have Low Prey DriveTendency To Bark Or Howl4Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes with barks or howls. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.See Dogs Who Are Mostly QuietWanderlust Potential4Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses--or that bunny that just ran across the path--even if it means leaving you behind.See Dogs Less Prone To Wander Physical NeedsEnergy Level4High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells.Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying.Your dog's energy level can also be affected by health issues. Adding Bernie's Perfect Poop digestion support treats to your pet's diet can help them feel better and improve their overall health!See Dogs Who Have Low EnergyIntensity4A vigorous dog may or may not have high energy, but everything they do, they do with vigor: they strain on the leash (until you train them not to), try to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life.See Dogs With Low IntensityExercise Needs4Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise, especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, like herding or hunting.Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility.Even older dogs need exercise, and it can help fight symptoms of arthritis and other age-related conditions. Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to your dog's routine can give your dog the joint supplements they need to stay active well into old age.See Dogs Who Don't Need Tons of ExercisePotential For Playfulness3Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful pup sounds endearing, consider how many games of fetch or tag you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other dogs who can stand in as playmates for the dog.You may want to consider adopting an older dog. Seniors can remain playful well into old age and have fewer demands than young dogs. Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to your senior's routine can help fight the symptoms of arthritis and keep your old dog active and playful.See Dogs Who Are Less PlayfulVital Stats:Dog Breed Group:Mixed Breed DogsHeight:20 to 29 inchesWeight:50 to 75 poundsLife Span:10 to 12 yearsMore About This BreedHighlightsAfadors are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Afghan Hound or Labrador Retriever parents.The most common Afador colors include black, brown, gray, red, and fawn.Shedding will definitely occur! Lots of grooming is required to keep the breed's coat in good condition--consider twice weekly brushing to be the minimum.The Afador does much better in colder climates rather than warm ones. Even so, kit your Afador out with a suitable winter coat if temperatures really drop.As an athletic mixed breed, the Afador will love to play fetch and folic in a safe off-leash environment. If you have a fenced-in yard, be warned that this is a dog that can easily leap over a six foot fence, so plan accordingly.Due to the breed's intelligence and stubborn streak, you'll want to make sure that both the dog and your children are properly trained to be around each other from day one.HistoryThe Afador is considered to be a rare mixed breed. They originated in Alaska.When it comes to the Afador's parental heritage, the Afghan Hound is estimated to be one of the oldest breeds in the world. On the Labrador Retriever side, the breed has earned a reputation for being a great guide and working dog. It's also one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States of America.The Afador has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Afador to your home.SizeThe Afador is usually described as a medium-sized dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 50 to 75 pounds and range in height from 20 to 29 inches. Female Afadors are often noticeably smaller than their male counterparts.PersonalityLet's get straight to the point: The Afador is a dog that has a reputation for being very tricky to train. This comes from the breed's innate intelligence, which can also result in a stubborn streak. An experienced dog owner will be better suited to correctly training the Afador. If you have young kids in the house, also beware that the athletic nature of the breed can mean that children might get knocked over or injured during play sessions with the dog.Once properly trained, your Afador will prove to be a super loyal dog. They can perform guard duty and will bark to alert you to the presence of strangers.Afadors also require a strict exercise routine--otherwise there's a chance they'll get used to being lazy and might pick up associated health problems. If you have a large yard, then you'll be better suited to adopting an Afador.HealthAfadors are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Afadors suffer from include:BloatHip and Elbow DysplasiaSubaortic StenosisCareAs with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Afador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Aim to provide the breed with around 45 minutes of exercise per day as a minimum. As an athletic mixed breed, the Afador will love to play fetch and folic in a safe off-leash environment. If you have a fenced-in yard, be warned that this is a dog that can easily leap over a six foot fence, so plan accordingly.Beyond exercise, make sure to check your Afador's ears at least once a week. This way, you'll be able to clean them and make sure there's no risk of wax building up. Ask your vet for advice if you're unsure of how best to clean a dog's ears. Clip their nails as needed. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can give you advice on how to do this.FeedingAn ideal Afador diet should be formulated for a medium breed with high energy.Afadors need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems--especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Afador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Afador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.Coat Color And GroomingThe most common Afador colors include black, brown, gray, red, and fawn.The Afador's coat is medium in length and is usually described as straight with a medium density. Shedding will definitely occur! Lots of grooming is required to keep the breed's coat in good condition--consider twice weekly brushing to be the minimum. Also get ready to undertake regular shampooing sessions. Your vet can help you select an appropriate shampoo to use.The Afador does much better in colder climates rather than warm ones. Even so, kit your Afador out with a suitable winter coat if temperatures really drop.Children And Other PetsIf you have very young children, the Afador might not be the best match for your family. The breed does much better with older children--not least because Afadors can become quite boisterous during play times. Due to the breed's intelligence and stubborn streak, you'll want to make sure that both the dog and your children are properly trained to be around each other from day one.Most Afadors will be okay living with other animals and pets--but you will need to very quickly let the breed know that cats and rabbits are not to be considered as prey.Ultimately, early socialization pays off--so make sure to reward your Afador for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.Rescue GroupsIt may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Afadors because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Afghan Hound or Labrador Retriever breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Afghan Hound Rescue of Southern California, Inc.Lucky Lab Rescue & AdoptionYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed
