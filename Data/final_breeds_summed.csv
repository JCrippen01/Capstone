Affenpinscher,9,12,8,12,5,4,1,3,3,1,1,3,4,1,2,4,4,"The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing."
Afghan Hound,25,27,50,60,5,3,2,5,5,5,4,1,3,4,1,4,5,"The Afghan Hound is an ancient breed, his whole appearance one of dignity and aloofness – his eyes gazing into the distance as if in memory of ages past. An intelligent and independent mind, his whole appearance one of dignity and style. To his own he is devoted and loyal with a charming and lively personality. The Afghan Hound is an athlete capable of immense speed and requires a large fenced in yard and exercise daily."
Akita,26,28,80,120,2,2,1,5,2,1,5,1,4,4,2,3,4,"Akitas are quiet, fastidious dogs. Wary of strangers and often intolerant of other animals, Akitas will gladly share their silly, affectionate side with family and friends. They thrive on human companionship. The large, independent-thinking Akita is hardwired for protecting those they love. They must be well socialized from birth with people and other dogs."
Alaskan Malamute,na,na,na,na,1,1,1,5,2,3,5,1,4,4,4,4,5,"Mals are pack animals. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with—playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids."
American Foxhound,22,25,65,70,1,2,1,4,4,5,3,5,5,3,2,3,5,"So far, so good. But Foxhounds come with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and destructive. A Foxhound’s single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners."
American Staffordshire Terrier,17,19,40,50,2,2,2,2,3,4,2,4,3,3,4,4,3,"AmStaffers describe their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable “personality dogs” around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest. When acquiring an AmStaff, there’s only one way to go: Do your homework and find a responsible AKC breeder."
American Water Spaniel,15,18,25,45,2,2,1,2,4,5,3,3,3,3,4,3,5,"The breed’s admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and retrievers. The key to the American Water Spaniel’s happiness is activity, especially alongside their adored human. An underemployed dog can be barky and destructive."
Australian Cattle Dog,17,20,35,45,2,1,3,4,4,3,3,4,5,3,5,5,5,"ACDs have immense work drive and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners."
Australian Shepherd,18,23,40,60,1,2,2,4,4,4,3,1,2,3,5,5,5,"Aussies exhibit an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs, kids. This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner. Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice owner. In short, this isn’t the pet for everyone. But if you’re looking for a brainy, tireless, and trainable partner for work or sport, your search might end here."
Australian Terrier,10,10,10,14,5,3,2,3,4,3,1,5,5,1,3,4,5,"Aussies move with the free and easy gait of a working dog. They are alert watchdogs and said to be quick studies when training. True terriers, Aussies love digging, and the urge to chase small, furry critters has never left them. Not always a great fit in multi-dog households, Aussies want you all to themselves."
Basenji,17,17,20,22,5,4,4,1,4,5,1,5,2,2,1,4,5," It’s true, they don’t bark, but they make their feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel. Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a “cult breed”—small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion."
Basset Hound,14,14,40,50,5,4,3,2,2,5,4,5,1,3,2,4,2,"Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed’s scenting ability is uncanny; it’s said that among dogs only the Bloodhound’s nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal."
Beagle,13,16,18,30,4,3,1,2,4,5,3,4,1,2,1,4,4,"A breed described as “merry” by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable—all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime."
Bearded Collie,20,22,40,60,3,4,2,4,3,4,4,2,3,3,5,4,4,"These rambunctious comics can be a handful—but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing sidekick."
Bedlington Terrier,15,16,18,23,4,4,3,4,3,4,5,1,4,3,3,5,4,"Rollicking, charming, and full of fun, Bedlingtons want most to be their family’s center of attention and are known to be protective of loved ones. For an active family looking for a no-shedding, lively, and loyal companion, the search might end here."
Belgian Malinois,22,26,60,65,1,3,3,4,4,4,2,5,4,4,5,5,5,"If you have ever seen a Mal perform an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected. Exercise, and plenty of it, preferably side by side with their adored owner, is key to Mal happiness."
Belgian Sheepdog,22,26,60,75,3,3,3,4,3,5,5,3,3,4,5,5,5,"In any sport or activity, a Belgian will always give 100 percent. In turn, owners tend to form a special bond with their eager workaholics. As one devotee puts it, Belgians “inspire such intense loyalty because they themselves live and love with such great passion.”"
Belgian Tervuren,22,26,60,75,3,3,1,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,5,5,5,"“Their intelligence and high activity level can be a challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed’s need to work,” warns one longtime owner. But don’t get the idea that Tervurens are grim, mechanical worker drones. In fact, this breed takes real delight in their ability to master any task, and owners say a mischievous sense of humor is at work whenever Tervurens outsmart their beloved human."
Bernese Mountain Dog,23,27,85,110,1,2,1,5,1,5,5,3,1,5,4,4,4,"A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner’s brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of Switzerland. Berners get along with the entire family and are particularly gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity with strangers.  "
Bichon Frise,9.5,11.5,10,18,5,5,1,3,4,4,2,1,4,2,5,4,5,"Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well with other dogs and children. Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs—but they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no strangers, just friends they haven’t met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally, there’s the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go."
Black Russian Terrier,25,29,80,140,3,2,2,4,3,5,3,2,3,5,4,4,3,"The tousled, all-black coat is warm enough to allow Black Russian Terriers to patrol some of the coldest habitable places on earth. The old expression “He moves well for a big guy” applies to this nimble-footed giant."
Bloodhound,24,26,80,120,1,2,2,3,3,5,4,1,3,4,3,4,5,"As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience training these sensitive sleuths can be a challenge."
Border Collie,19,21,40,40,2,2,1,4,4,4,3,3,2,3,5,5,5,"The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agility—or herding or obedience work—is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved with strangers."
Border Terrier,12,15,12,15,4,3,1,4,3,4,3,2,4,2,3,5,4,"Borders are described as “hard as nails” when working, but at home they’re good-tempered, affectionate, and trainable. Borders love exploring outdoors and make fine childhood playmates. Bred to be country dogs, Borders adapt well to city life—as long as they get plenty of exercise. Borders tend to get along with other dogs, but their hunting instincts can be aroused when cats or squirrels cross their path."
Borzoi,26,28,70,100,5,3,1,4,3,3,5,4,4,5,3,4,2,"In their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room is a must."
Boston Terrier,14,15,15,25,5,4,3,3,2,5,2,5,4,2,4,4,4,"Bostons are sturdy but portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of smiles."
Boxer,21,25,65,70,4,3,1,2,1,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,5,Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early puppyhood.
Briard,23,27,74,76,3,3,3,4,3,5,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,"They possess traits common to many other herders: trainability, brains, a protective eye toward family (especially kids, whom they regard as their flock), and wariness with outsiders. These are large, tireless dogs—it is said that just two or three Briards can handle 700 head of sheep—and novice owners might be overwhelmed by their work drive and zest for life."
Brittany,17,21,30,40,1,3,1,4,3,5,3,3,4,3,3,5,5,"The zeal and versatility that make Brittanys peerless hunters can be channeled into dog sports. Obedience, agility, flyball, dock diving—you name it, this trainable breed is up for it. The Brittany is a nice fit for those seeking an all-purpose hunting partner, a dog-sport teammate, or a companion in sync with an upbeat, outdoorsy family life."
Brussels Griffon,7,8,6,12,5,2,1,1,2,4,3,3,3,1,3,4,5,"Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained. Although playful and energetic, their small size and sensitive nature make them a poor choice as roughhousing playmates for kids. They have a low threshold for loneliness and will stick close to their special human, providing years of love and laughter."
Bull Terrier,21,22,50,70,4,3,2,1,4,5,3,5,4,2,5,4,4,"There are four keys to this breed’s happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met, there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion. This is the ultimate “personality breed.”"
Bullmastiff,25,27,100,130,3,2,2,4,2,5,1,5,2,5,3,3,2,"These are biddable and reliable creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization early, while the puppy is still small enough to control."
Cairn Terrier,9,10,14,14,5,4,1,4,4,5,3,5,4,1,2,5,5,"A British breed club promotes Cairns as the “best little pal in the world.” Cairns are small enough for a lap-top snuggle and sturdy enough for a good romp on the lawn. They do best with lots of close family contact. For owners who cherish the terrier qualities of gameness, independent thinking, and true-blue loyalty, no other breed will do."
Canaan Dog,19,24,35,55,4,2,3,3,5,2,4,5,5,3,5,4,4,"Canaans are clever, confident, and territorial. They will end up “owning” passive owners who haven’t establish themselves as top dog in the family pack. Early training and socialization are key. When positive methods are applied, these ancient wonder-dogs train beautifully. Agility, obedience, herding trials, and sentry duty are a few outlets for their work ethic."
Cardigan Welsh Corgi,10,12,25,35,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,3,4,2,4,5,3,"Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians with a “big dog” bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity."
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel,10,15,15,20,5,5,1,3,2,5,3,4,4,2,4,4,3,"Cavaliers may be aristocrats, but they gladly descend from their royal high horse for a backyard frolic or a squirrel chase. They get along nicely with children and other dogs. Adaptable Cavaliers do equally well with active owners and homebodies—they can be upbeat athletes or shameless couch potatoes, depending on an owner’s lifestyle."
Chesapeake Bay Retriever,21,26,55,75,1,1,2,4,4,3,5,5,4,3,3,4,5,"Chessies are more emotionally complex than the usual gundog. Chessies take to training, but they have a mind of their own and can tenaciously pursue their own path. They are protective of their humans and polite, but not overtly friendly, to strangers. Chessies make excellent watchdogs and are versatile athletes. A well-socialized Chessie is a confident companion and world-class hunting buddy."
Chihuahua,6,9,2,5,5,4,1,1,2,5,2,5,2,1,4,4,3,"Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable—as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap."
Chinese Crested,11,13,5,12,5,3,1,1,3,5,2,2,5,2,4,3,2,"Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn’t much of a problem. Both varieties are attentive housemates, totally in tune with their family."
Chow Chow,19,22,45,55,3,2,5,5,2,1,1,1,2,4,2,1,2,"Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life."
Clumber Spaniel,19,20,35,65,5,5,2,5,2,3,5,1,2,3,4,3,3,"Clumbers are sweet and easygoing at home, but these outdoorsy fellows can be relentless on scent. Smart and eager-to-please Clumbers respond well to training. Though a bit wary around strangers, Clumbers are friendly dogs who bark only when they have something to say, and so make indifferent watchdogs. They love swimming and fetching, and are sturdy childhood playmates."
Coton de Tulear,not found,not found,not found,not found,5,4,1,3,3,5,1,2,5,1,3,4,3,"The bond between Cotons and their people is so tight that owners discuss it in human terms. Coton fanciers describe them as “witty” companions “at times boisterous but never demanding” and “naturally clownish and lighthearted,” who possess a “remarkably gentle, sympathetic awareness.” Amusing traits of these long-lived jesters include unique vocalizations and a knack for walking on their hind legs."
Dachshund,7,10,16,32,5,4,3,1,3,5,3,3,2,1,2,4,3,"Dachshunds aren’t built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything. Smart and vigilant, with a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions of hearts the world over."
Dalmatian,19,23,45,70,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,4,3,4,4,5,"The Dal was originally bred to guard horses and coaches, and some of the old protective instinct remains. Reserved and dignified, Dals can be aloof with strangers and are dependable watchdogs. With their preferred humans, Dals are bright, loyal, and loving house dogs. They are strong, active athletes with great stamina—a wonderful partner for runners and hikers."
Dandie Dinmont Terrier,18,24,8,11,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,2,3,1,2,3,3,"Weighing no more than 24 pounds, Dandies are alert and intelligent watchdogs with a big baritone bark. Dandies enjoy romping and cuddling with kids, but aren’t as hyper as some small dogs. They are terriers, though, with typical willfulness, independence, and courage. Dandie owners get best results with positive, motivational training."
Doberman Pinscher,26,28,60,100,3,3,2,1,4,3,4,5,1,4,5,5,3,"With a noble, wedge-shaped head and an easy, athletic way of moving have earned Dobermans a reputation as royalty in the canine kingdom. A well-conditioned Doberman on patrol will deter all but the most foolish intruder."
English Foxhound,22,25,65,70,1,2,4,3,3,4,3,5,4,3,3,3,5,"These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired for the chase."
English Setter,23,27,45,80,1,3,1,4,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,5,4,"A graceful neck carries a long, oval-shaped head proudly, and dark brown eyes convey a soft expression. The merry English Setter is known as the gentleman of the dog world but is game and boisterous at play. English Setters get on well with other dogs and people. A veteran all-breed dog handler says, “As a breed to share one’s life and living space with, no other breed gives me more pleasure than the English Setter.”"
English Springer Spaniel,20,20,45,55,1,3,1,3,4,5,3,2,3,3,5,5,5,"Bred to work closely with humans, Springers are highly trainable people-pleasers. They crave company and are miserable when neglected.Polite dogs, Springers are good with kids and their fellow mammals. They are eager to join in any family activity. Long walks, games of chase and fetch, and swimming are favorite pastimes of these rugged spaniels."
English Toy Spaniel,10,10,9,15,4,4,1,2,2,1,5,4,2,2,3,3,3,"The ETS, like many toy breeds kept by royals, came to assume the personalities of their aristocratic owners. They can be proud and willful, and extremely discriminating in their choice of friends. With their favored humans, they are affectionate at home and exuberant and curious at play."
Field Spaniel,18,18,35,50,1,3,1,3,4,5,3,4,3,2,5,5,5,"Field Spaniels are sweet, sensitive souls with just enough independence to make life interesting. They are trustworthy with kids, tolerant of their fellow mammals, and responsive to training. The U.S. breed standard calls these tranquil house dogs “unusually docile,” but they are nonetheless playful and enjoy a good backyard romp."
Finnish Spitz,15,20,31,35,3,3,1,5,3,5,4,2,4,3,3,4,5,"Finkies  make excellent alertdogs, wary but not shy with strangers. This is a vocal breed – in Finland, owners hold contests to crown a “King Barker” – and true Finn lovers are more delighted than annoyed by their breed’s yodeling and range of vocalization. Finkies are eager canine athletes and eye-catching show dogs known to be smart, sensitive, and captivating companions."
French Bulldog,11,12,17,28,5,5,1,2,1,4,3,5,2,2,4,3,3,"The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don’t bark much—but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed."
German Pinscher,16,19,25,35,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,5,4,3,4,5,5,"There’s nobility in the elongated, wedge-shaped head, and the dark eyes are alert and eager. German Pinschers move with the kind of strong, free-and-easy gait that tells you this is a confident companion, up for anything the day might bring."
German Shepherd Dog,22,26,75,90,3,2,2,4,3,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,"There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there’s a “certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.”"
German Shorthaired Pointer,20,27,50,80,1,2,1,2,4,5,2,5,3,3,5,5,5,"Built to work long days in the field or at the lake, GSPs are known for power, speed, agility, and endurance. “Noble” and “aristocratic” are words often used to describe the overall look. GSPs make happy, trainable pets who bond firmly to their family. They are always up for physical activities like running, swimming, organized dog sports—in fact, anything that will burn some of their boundless energy while spending outdoors time with a human buddy."
German Wirehaired Pointer,22,26,60,70,2,3,2,3,4,3,2,4,4,4,4,5,5,"“This breed will not be happy to be on the couch all day.” German Wirehaired Pointers are bright and eager, but their independent, inquisitive nature might frustrate novice owners. A good fit for those looking for a loving companion who enjoys sports and togetherness."
Giant Schnauzer,25,28,70,75,1,1,2,4,2,3,4,2,4,4,5,4,5,"The muscular, substantial body is, as the breed’s fanciers put it, a “bold and valiant figure of a dog.” The double coat is either solid black or “pepper and salt.” Familiar characteristics of the Mini, Standard, and Giant are a harsh beard and eyebrows, accentuating a keen, sagacious expression."
Golden Retriever,21,24,55,75,2,3,1,3,3,5,5,2,2,3,5,5,5,"Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes."
Gordon Setter,23,27,45,80,2,3,1,4,3,3,5,2,4,3,5,5,5," Like other Scots breeds, from the compact Scottish Terrier to the majestic Scottish Deerhound, Gordons were built to withstand their homeland’s tough terrain and foul weather."
Great Dane,32,32,120,160,1,1,1,2,3,5,5,5,4,5,5,3,5,"Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily."
Great Pyrenees,27,32,95,120,1,1,3,5,3,4,5,4,2,5,1,4,5,"These steadfast guardians usually exhibit a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly spring into action and move with grace and speed to meet a threat. The lush weatherproof coat is all white, or white with markings of beautiful shades of gray, tan, reddish-brown, or badger."
Greyhound,27,30,60,70,4,2,1,1,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,"The lean beauty of the Greyhound’s “inverted S” shape, created by the deep chest curving gently into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from which other coursing hounds have been struck."
Harrier,19,21,40,60,1,3,3,3,4,5,3,5,5,3,2,4,5,"Harriers have the timeless look of a working pack hound: a short, smart-looking coat; low-set, velvety ears; an irresistibly sweet face; and enough muscle and sinew to endure a long day’s hunt. A well-built Harrier will cover ground with a smooth, efficient gait."
Ibizan Hound,22,29,42,55,5,3,2,1,4,5,3,5,4,3,3,4,5,"Ibizans are lithe and leggy visitors from the dawn of civilization. Art history students will recognize the elongated head, with its large erect ears, as a familiar motif of ancient Egypt. The elegant, racy body stands 22.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder, with coat colors of solid red or white, or red and white patterns."
Irish Setter,25,27,60,70,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,2,4,4,5,5,"The Irish Setter’s lovable personality has endeared the breed to sportsmen and pet owners for more than 200 years. Irish are outgoing dogs who enjoy making friends. These rambunctious redheads are big kids at heart, but they are eager to please and will respond to patient, positive training. They are said to be bold and rugged hunting partners, with a devil-may-care approach to their work."
Irish Terrier,18,19,25,27,3,2,2,4,4,5,4,2,5,3,1,4,5,"ITs are a dog lover’s delight: If your heart doesn’t go pitty-pat at the sight of this Technicolor terrier framed against the vivid greens of the Irish countryside, forget dogs and buy a goldfish."
Irish Water Spaniel,10,23,45,65,3,2,3,4,4,5,1,3,2,3,5,4,5,"Among its distinguishing characteristics are a crisply curled, liver-colored, waterproof coat; a tapered “rat tail”; and a cleanly chiseled head crowned with a topknot of long, loose curls. The IWS moves with a smooth ground-covering gait, enabling him to put in a long day’s work in the field."
Irish Wolfhound,28,35,90,150,1,2,2,4,2,5,3,3,1,5,3,4,2,"IWs are too serene to be fierce guard dogs, but just the sight of them is enough to deter intruders. IWs are characteristically patient with kids, though animals their size should be supervised around small children. Owning an Irish Wolfhound is a unique, rewarding experience—but acquiring a giant galloping hound is a commitment as big as the dog itself."
Italian Greyhound,12,15,6,10,5,5,1,1,3,5,2,5,3,2,3,3,4,"IGs combine the attentiveness of lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored. “On the whole,” writes an IG expert, “the breed would much rather be in your lap or bed than on the floor.” They are, though, true sighthounds and will bolt after quick-moving prey at the drop of a cat. A short-coat, low-fat breed, IGs require extra care in cold weather"
Japanese Chin,8,11,4,11,5,4,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,2,"The Japanese Chin is a charming toy companion of silky, profuse coat and an unmistakably aristocratic bearing. Often described as a distinctly “feline” breed, this bright and amusing lapdog is fastidious, graceful, and generally quiet."
Keeshond,17,19,35,50,4,4,1,5,3,5,5,3,3,3,4,4,4,"The amiable Keeshond is a medium-sized spitz dog of ample coat, famous for the distinctive “spectacles” on his foxy face. Once a fixture on the canal barges of his native Holland, the Kees was, and remains, a symbol of Dutch patriotism."
Kerry Blue Terrier,17,21,30,45,3,2,3,4,3,4,1,2,3,3,4,4,4,"Among the largest of AKC terriers, the Kerry Blue Terrier is famous for his show-stopping blue coat. Named for the Irish county of his birth, this onetime farm dog is today an alert, adaptable, and animated watchdog and family companion."
Komondor,26.5,35.5,80,135,2,1,1,4,3,3,3,2,2,4,4,4,2,"A powerfully large Hungarian flock guardian covered in profuse white cords from head to tail, the Komondor is among the world’s most recognizable breeds. The independent and protective Kom requires a firm, experienced hand at training."
Kuvasz,28,30,70,120,1,1,1,5,2,1,4,4,4,5,2,4,4,"The Kuvasz is Hungary's majestic guardian breed and hunting companion of kings. A working dog of larger size, the imposing, white, thickly-coated Kuvasz is beautiful, intelligent, independent and profoundly loyal."
Labrador Retriever,21,24,55,80,1,3,2,3,3,5,5,5,3,4,5,5,5,"Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don’t mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit."
Lakeland Terrier,13,14,15,17,4,3,2,4,4,4,2,2,5,2,2,4,5,"A bold, zesty “big dog in a small package,” the Lakeland Terrier, named for the Lake District of his native England, was once a farmer’s dog bred to work in packs on sheep-stealing foxes. The Lakeland's coat is hard, wiry, and low-shedding."
Maltese,8,10,4,6,5,5,1,1,3,3,2,2,3,1,4,4,3,"Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training."
Mastiff,27,30,175,190,2,1,3,4,1,5,3,3,3,5,3,2,3," Mastiffs are patient, lovable companions and guardians who take best to gentle training. Eternally loyal Mastiffs are protective of family, and a natural wariness of strangers makes early training and socialization essential. Mastiffs are magnificent pets, but acquiring a powerful giant-breed dog is commitment not to be taken lightly."
Newfoundland,26,28,100,150,1,3,1,5,2,5,5,2,1,5,5,4,3,"The Newfie breed standard says that a sweet temperament is the “most important single characteristic of the breed.” The Newf’s sterling character is expressed in their affinity for kids. Trusting and trainable, Newfs respond well to gentle guidance. These noble giants are among the world’s biggest dogs, and acquiring a pet that could outweigh you comes with obvious challenges."
Norwegian Elkhound,19,20,40,60,4,4,2,5,3,4,5,3,4,3,2,4,5,"Elkhounds are famously fine companions and intelligent watchdogs. Agility and herding trials are good outlets for their natural athleticism and eagerness. Reserved until introductions are made, an Elkhound is a trustworthy friend ever after. These strong, confident dogs are truly sensitive souls, with a dash of houndy independence."
Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever,17,21,35,50,5,3,2,4,4,5,3,5,4,3,4,5,5,"Tollers are upbeat athletes who require outlets for their boundless vigor: hunting, hiking, camping, and, of course, swimming (for which they are ideally suited, down to their webbed feet). Tollers are smart, handsome, affectionate companions, but these red tornadoes can be recommended only to those with enough time and energy to keep them usefully occupied."
Papillon,8,11,5,10,5,5,1,2,4,3,2,3,3,1,5,4,4,"The quick, curious Papillon is a toy dog of singular beauty and upbeat athleticism. Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a “doggy dog” blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly."
Pharaoh Hound,21,25,45,55,4,4,2,1,5,5,2,4,5,3,3,4,2,"The Pharaoh Hound, ancient ""Blushing Dog"" of Malta, is an elegant but rugged sprinting hound bred to course small game over punishing terrain. Quick and tenacious on scent, these friendly, affectionate hounds settle down nicely at home."
Pointer,21,24,44,66,1,1,1,2,4,5,3,5,3,3,5,5,5,"The Pointer is the ultimate expression of canine power and grace. The breed’s name is its job description: Pointers point game birds, and they have been pointing for centuries. The high-energy Pointer is an excellent runner’s companion."
Polish Lowland Sheepdog,16,20,30,35,4,2,3,4,4,4,1,1,4,3,4,4,4,"A shaggy-coated herding dog who thrives on exercise and hard work, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog is clever, confident, and a bit stubborn. Compact, alert, and adaptable, they are beloved companions and watchdogs of Polish city dwellers."
Pomeranian,12,12,3,7,4,4,1,4,2,2,4,2,3,1,4,4,3,"The tiny Pomeranian, long a favorite of royals and commoners alike, has been called the ideal companion. The glorious coat, smiling, foxy face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the world's most popular toy breeds."
Portuguese Water Dog,20,23,42,60,4,3,2,4,3,5,1,2,4,3,4,5,5,"The Portuguese Water Dog is super-smart and very biddable—meaning he’s easy to train and eager to please. The breed can be groomed in two styles: The retriever clip (the entire coat is clipped to one inch in length, with the tail tip at full length) or the more check-me-out lion clip, where the coat on the hindquarters and muzzle is clipped down to the skin."
Pug,10,11,14,22,5,5,1,2,1,4,5,5,1,2,3,2,3,"Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city or country, with kids or old folks, as an only pet or in a pack. They enjoy their food, and care must be taken to keep them trim. They do best in moderate climates—not too hot, not too cold—but, with proper care, Pugs can be their adorable selves anywhere."
Puli,16,17,29,33,4,1,2,4,3,5,1,1,5,3,2,4,5,"No other breed can be mistaken for the Puli, a compact but powerful herder covered from head to tail with profuse, naturally occurring cords. Bred to work closely with humans, these agile and faithful little dynamos are quick learners."
Redbone Coonhound,21,27,50,70,4,2,2,3,2,5,2,5,3,3,3,4,4,"The streamlined Redbone Coonhound, an American original, is even-tempered, mellow, and kindly at home but a tiger on the trail. Vigorous activities like hunting and swimming between long periods of rest is the rhythm of coonhound life."
Rhodesian Ridgeback,24,27,70,85,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,4,2,4,4,"The formidable Ridgeback can be strong willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust. Still, a Ridgeback can be too much hound for the novice dog owner."
Rottweiler,22,27,90,110,2,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,5,4,"A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he’s not a toy breed, so he is liable to plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie’s territorial instincts in a positive way."
Saint Bernard,25,28,110,190,3,2,1,5,1,5,4,2,2,5,2,4,3,"The Saint Bernard does not rank very high in AKC registrations, but the genial giant of the Swiss Alps is nonetheless among the world’s most famous and beloved breeds. Saints are famously watchful, patient, and careful with children."

Samoyed,19,24,50,65,2,2,2,5,1,5,5,1,3,3,3,3,5,"A Sammy sentenced to solitary confinement in the yard is a miserable—and destructive—creature. These are smart, social, mischievous dogs who demand love and attention. Sammies need a very firm but loving hand in training."
Schipperke,10,13,12,18,4,2,3,3,2,5,3,5,4,1,2,4,5,"The Schipperke, Belgium's ""little captain,"" is the traditional barge dog of the Low Countries. Curious, lively, and intense but mischievous, this little black dog is a robust, long-lived companion for whom there is never a dull moment."
Scottish Deerhound,28,32,75,110,1,1,2,4,4,4,5,2,3,5,2,3,5,"The crisply coated Scottish Deerhound, “Royal Dog of Scotland,” is a majestically large coursing hound struck from the ancient Greyhound template. Among the tallest of dog breeds, the Deerhound was bred to stalk the giant wild red deer."
Scottish Terrier,10,12,18,22,4,2,3,4,3,4,2,2,4,2,1,4,4,"The Scottie working style has been described as efficient and businesslike, and their aloofness toward strangers makes them excellent watchdogs. Their hunting instinct remains strong, which can complicate life for the neighbor’s cat, and Scotties are known to be cantankerous around other dogs. This bold and clever Scotsman enjoys brisk walks and upbeat play."
Sealyham Terrier,12,12,18,20,4,4,2,4,3,4,4,1,5,2,3,4,4,"A typical Sealy is well-muscled, built low to ground, and moves easily with long, determined strides. The weatherproof coat is predominantly white, and a long, broad head is furnished with lavish facial hair. Despite their rep as the bruiser among short-legged terriers, Sealys are cute, funny, affectionate, outgoing, and trainable, if a bit stubborn. Their alertness and a big-dog bark make Sealys excellent watchdogs. Blessed with an adaptable nature, Sealys are amenable to city dwelling or country life."
Shiba Inu,13,16,15,30,5,4,5,4,3,3,4,4,3,2,2,4,4,"An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country."
Shih Tzu,8,11,9,16,5,5,3,3,1,4,3,1,3,1,3,4,2,"Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu’s idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV."
Siberian Husky,20,23,40,60,2,1,1,5,3,5,4,2,4,3,2,3,5,"As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor."
Silky Terrier,9,10,8,11,5,3,3,1,4,3,2,4,4,1,4,4,4,"A charming member of the AKC Toy Group, the compact, glossy-coated Silky Terrier is nonetheless a true terrier of energetic high spirits. The Silky, a native of Sydney, Australia, is larger than his close cousin, the Yorkshire Terrier."
Skye Terrier,10,10,25,25,4,4,2,4,4,4,3,3,5,2,2,4,3,"“The heavenly breed with the heart of a lion,” the long, low, and level Skye Terrier is among the AKC’s most distinctive-looking breeds. This elegant but sturdy aristocrat was bred as an exterminator on Scotland’s remote Isle of Skye."
Spinone Italiano,23,28,65,80,4,4,2,4,3,5,3,2,3,4,4,4,4,"The Spinone Italiano (plural: Spinoni Italiani) is a squarely and solidly built all-around hunter. Spinoni are muscular and powerful, built more for endurance than speed. The dense coat has a natural, unclippered look and comes in various colors and patterns. The face conveys the breed’s abundant Old World charm. Those soft, sweetly expressive eyes set off by shaggy eyebrows and a tufted beard have won many a heart in Italy—and they’re making new conquests here in America every day."
Staffordshire Bull Terrier,14,16,24,28,3,1,2,3,1,5,3,5,3,2,2,3,3,"Staffordshire Bull Terriers still resemble the pugnacious brawlers who once ruled England’s fighting pits. But today’s responsible breeders are producing sweet-natured, family-oriented dogs with a reputation for being patient with kids. These are true-blue loyal companions, but the old fighting instinct still lurks within—making it vital that pups be socialized with other dogs to learn good canine manners."
Standard Schnauzer,17,19,33,33,4,2,2,4,4,4,1,2,5,3,3,5,5,"Standards are sociable companions, alert watchdogs, enthusiastic backyard squirrel chasers, and are good with kids and protective of loved ones.

Tibetan Mastiff,24,26,140,170,1,1,1,5,2,5,2,4,3,5,1,5,4,"Watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme. These densely-coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers."
Tibetan Spaniel,10,10,9,15,5,4,1,1,2,5,3,4,5,1,4,4,3,"The frisky and curious Tibetan Spaniel was bred ages ago for sentinel work on the walls of Tibetan monasteries. Known for a flat, silky coat and “lion’s mane” around the neck, the Tibetan Spaniel forms a tight, worshipful bond with their humans."
Tibetan Terrier,14,17,20,30,5,3,1,4,4,5,1,1,5,2,4,4,5,"The Tibetan Terrier, “Holy Dog of Tibet,” is an ancient watchdog and companion long associated with Buddhist monasteries. A profusely coated, small-to-medium-sized dog with “snowshoe” feet, this breed is affectionate, sensitive, and clever."

Weimaraner,25,27,70,85,1,2,1,3,4,4,4,5,3,4,4,5,5,"Weimaraners are excellent with kids and yearn to be full-fledged family members.

Welsh Springer Spaniel,16,19,35,45,4,4,1,4,4,5,3,4,4,3,5,5,5,"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a vigorous, medium-sized bird dog of happy disposition, known for versatility in the field, companionability at home, and dashing good looks anywhere. The Welshie is among Britain's oldest sporting breeds."
Welsh Terrier,15,15,20,21,3,3,2,2,2,5,2,2,5,2,3,5,5,"The Welsh Terrier is as alert and spirited as any self-respecting terrier, but a bit calmer than most—“game, not quarrelsome,” as breed fanciers say. The Welshman was bred to do battle with badgers, otters, and other dangerous opponents."
West Highland White Terrier,11,11,13,15,4,4,2,4,3,4,4,3,3,2,4,4,4,"Alert and active, Westies exhibit traits of a plucky and self-reliant ratting terrier: They require no pampering, they will chase after anything that moves, and their independence can make training a challenge. But, thanks to their faithfulness and keen intelligence, Westies will train nicely with time and patience."
Whippet,18,22,27,30,5,3,2,1,4,5,2,5,4,3,4,4,5,"Between bursts of intense pursuit, Whippets love to stretch out and relax for long hours, enjoying the role of a loving, and loved, companion. Whippets like a fenced yard to run in, but they do nicely in cozy apartments too—as long as they are exercised properly. Another plus for city dwellers: Whippets rarely bark. Despite the breed’s elegant looks, the Whippet is a robust, low-maintenance dog."
Wirehaired Pointing Griffon,20,24,45,60,1,3,1,4,3,5,1,3,4,3,5,5,5,"The hardworking Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, renowned as the “supreme gundog,” is known for the harsh, low-shedding coat the breed is named for.

Yorkshire Terrier,8,8,3,7,5,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,1,3,3,5,"Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies."
